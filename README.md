### Help us create better docs
It's a clich√© that open-source projects have terrible documentation. We don't want to be one of those! So please tell us about our docs: are they too verbose? Or too terse? What needed more explanation or more examples? Were they organized sensibly?
 
### Tell us what's missing
What should WebDriver-Manager be able to do, but currently doesn't?
